# SimpleIOT: App Layer: Greengrass v2
# iotggv2.py
#
# This creates a GGv2 Nucleus Core component (including embedded IOT Thing) and returns settings
# data in the same format as the iotthing.py library.
#
# The operations include:
#
# - Create/Delete ggv2 Nucleus Core
# - Create and attach client devices to the device group
# - Add or remove local lambdas
# - Add/modify/remove MQTT Bridge Topics
#
import boto3

ggv2 = boto3.client('greengrassv2')

##### NOTE: ggv2 currently initiates all this creation from the device side.
##### This is different than how GGv1 did it.
#####
##### We'll need to revisit the flow to see if we want to override that and do the creation
##### in the lambda or leave it as-is. This can impact the provisioning workflow for gateways.
##### More data needed on deployment methods before making this change.
