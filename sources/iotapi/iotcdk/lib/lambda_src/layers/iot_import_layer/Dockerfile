# PYTHON_VERSION: version of python to use to create layer. Note that this should match the name
# of the container in DockerHub.

# We copy the python installation folder to the host so it can be used as part of CDK deployment.
# The buildlayer.sh script that invoked this with "--output out ." copies the contents of the root
# to the 'out' folder in the host. Then the CDK picks it up from the 'out' folder during
# lambda layer creation.
#
# NOTE that this build stage is from 'scratch' instead of 'build' and Docker CLI honors the
# COPY directive for the very last build stage.
