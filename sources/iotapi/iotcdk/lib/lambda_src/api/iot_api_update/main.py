# SimpleIOT: Firmware/File update
# iot_api_update
#
# This API allows firmware or configuration files to be queued for update to devices.
# The API is used to upload the payload, capture metadata, and invoke pushes to the
# systems out there. Devices that want to check if an update exists can also 'pull'
# via both REST calls or via specially formatted MQTT calls.
#
# To keep things in one place, all operations related to firmware updates are included
# here, with different functions disambiguated via an "item" operation command.
#
# The operations supported include:
#
# POST (item)
#   upload: returns a pre-signed URL to which the payload can be uploaded
#   payload: called when the payload has been uploaded to S3. This creates the Firmware record.
#   session: starts an update session, using a payload ID. This creates a range of UpdateDevice
#           records and sends them all notifications.
#
# PUT (item):
#   payload: allows modification of metadata associated with the payload.
#   update: called to update the status of each UpdateDevice session
#
# GET (item):
#   payload: returns information about all the uploaded payloads
#   session: returns information about all queued sessions
#   update: get information on each individual update targeted at a device
#
# DELETE (item):
#    payload: deletes a file from S3. There should be protections so if a session is
#             pointing at a payload and it's already been launched. If so, the payload can
#             not be removed.
#    session: deletes a session and all its related updates
#    update: deletes a device update (although this might have to be monitored and logged)

#
# To upload twin media files to be hosted by SimpleIOT is a multi-step process.
# First, a POST is called, passing the project and model. If the record already has
# a twin file registered, we delete the media file, erase the db field, then
# proceed as if it's a new upload.
#
# We get the name of the bucket from System Settings for "twinMediaBucketName"
#
# If there is no upload record for the model, we create a random name and a pre-signed
# URL, the base of which we save in the db record. The caller is then supposed to
# use the pre-signed URL to upload the media.
#
# Once done, they are supposed to call back to this routine and pass the pre-signed URL
# in as a parameter. If the base of that URL and the one we saved from the first step
# match, we assume the content is loaded, kick off a CloudFront invalidation and return success.
#
# If the URLs don't match, we erase the record inside the database record and return error.
#
# This scheme has a couple of potential flaws:
#
# Q: What if someone calls the first time but never calls the second?
# A: We set an expiration date of 15m for the URL so it expires. But the base record is left in the
#    model database. That will not have a file attached to it. When the model viewer goes to
#    request the file, we will be returning a URL of a file that is not there and will generate
#    a 404 error. ModelViewer will have to deal with that.
# Q: What if there is an upload error?
# A: The caller should call back with a DELETE to erase the record. Or, they can start with an
#    initial POST again to overwrite the pre-signed URL.
# Q: Are there malicious ways to abuse this?
# A: Never say never. However, to do so means they will have had to compromise the Cognito auth
#    to be able to call this method. Also, it would be possible to upload a file with a malicious
#    payload. Testing potential bad content could be tested there.
#
# To reset the whole scheme, you can call DELETE, with no parameters. If there is a URL
# in the Model, it will be deleted and the field will be erased so you can start again.

# Uploading a firmware update file is a multi-step process:
#
# 1. Generate a pre-signed S3 URL for uploading the firmware file.
# 2. Client uploads the file to that URL.
# 3. Call back with a confirmation when the file is loaded. We can validate the file if we want,
#    but this is where we go delete any old 3D model files, invalidate the URL in CloudFront,
#    then update the DB record so it points at the CloudFront entry.
#
# We do steps 1 and 3 via the same POST call, with the first one generating a pre-signed URL
# and a session ID. When the file has been uploaded, they call back POST again, this time
# with the item set to "payload" and we now go find the item in the S3 bucket, and do what has
# to happen as part of Step 3. If any of these fail, we leave the Model DB record alone.
# We'll want to have a way to clean out the session records that are never called back (orphaned).
#
# The URL placed in the Model record will be the Cloudfront-accessible URL
#
# If model already has an 3D GLB/USD/USDZ file in the record, we have to go and delete it,
# then we generate a pre-signed URL for uploading to a new spot and overwrite the old one.
#
# POST (item)
#   upload: returns a pre-signed URL to which the payload can be uploaded
#   payload: called when the payload has been uploaded to S3. This creates the Firmware record.
#   session: starts an update session, using a payload ID. This creates a range of UpdateDevice
#           records and sends them all notifications.

# they ask if there is an update, they'll re-receive the same update record and will fall

# This is called when an IOT rule invokes this lambda. There's no HTTP message in that case,
# so we pass it on to this routine. The messages involve requests sent through MQTT
# so the transmitter is assumed to have security via X.509 certificates instead HTTPS.
#
# The primary action is for a device (gateway or end-node) to check if a device needs an
# update. We check this by looking for UpdateTargets that match serial numbers, and are
# active. We can also check to see if the sent version matches or is less than the version
# in the UpdateTarget. If true, we generate an IOT response that tells the target to
# perform an update, along with the payload (which includes the URL of the actual payload).
#
# All calls to simpleiot_v1/app/update/... route to here. We distinguish between them via the
# "action" parameter in the payload.
#
# The 'action' parameters can be:
#
# check: to check if this device needs an update. If so, we publish back a 'doupdate'
# message to the device. We check in the UpdateTarget list for any update addressed
# to the listed device. If we find multiple records (likely), we check to see which
# ones are the latest, if the device firmware is less than the value of the update
# record AND have the state set to "pending." If the check call came in with
# a 'force' flag set to true, then we don't do the version state check and the version
# and just return with the highest version record.
#
# received: when a device has downloaded the binary payload, they will send a 'received'
# message to acknowledge that they've gotten the payload.
#
# installed: this is an optional call. If a device is capable of distinguishing between
# a normal boot and a boot-after-update state, they could use this to signal that the
# update was installed.
#
# For now, however, we stop sending back updates if we get a 'received' message, we assume
# the installation will go as planned.
#
# If not, the device can FORCE an update by doing a "CHECK" with a "force" flag set to
# true.
