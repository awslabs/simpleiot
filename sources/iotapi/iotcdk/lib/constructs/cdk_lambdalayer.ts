 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * If upgrading the python version, you need to make sure several things align:
 *
 * 1. Before you even start, make sure the version of Python you want is supported by lambda.
 *    Check here for the latest list of runtimes supported by Lambda:
 *        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html
 * 2. Next, make sure Psycopg2 is available *ON AWS*. Easiest way is to check here:
 *    https://github.com/jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2 and also check the psycopg2 library's issues as to which
 *    version it's been tested against. For example, as of October 2021 upgrading to Python3.9 wasn't quite
 *    supported yet: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1099. To verify, create a sample lambda and try it out.
 *
 * 3. Once you're sure it's compatible, snag the pre-built version at
 *    https://github.com/jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2 or build it from source on an
 *    EC2 instance.
 * 4. Copy the distribution into the
 *    simpleiot/sources/iotapi/iotcdk/lib/lambda_src/layers/iot_import_layer/python/lib/python{version}/site-packages/psycopg2
 *    directory. Make sure the "python{version}" is properly renamed, for example, "python3.8" is the right folder
 *    name.
 * 5. There is one file in the repos that uses a soft symbolic link pointing at the right path. The path
 *    includes the python version in the link, so that needs to be updated. In simpleiot/sources/iotapi/db there is
 *    a directory called "iotapp" this links to the lambda layer source directory.
 *
 *        iotapp -> ../iotcdk/lib/lambda_src/layers/iot_app_layer/python/lib/python{version}/site-packages/iotapp
 *
 * Under MacOS, you can change the link by deleteing the iotapp link and re-creating it to point at the proper
 * python version before doing a database load. For example, to point at python3.8:
 *
 * % cd simpleiot/sources/iotapi/db
 * % ls -al
 * % rm ./iotapp
 * % ln -s ../iotcdk/lib/lambda_src/layers/iot_app_layer/python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/iotapp .
 *
 * After this you can run the 'invoke dbsetup --team {my-team}' command and have it use the new python version.
 *
 * 6. Once this is done, now you need to change the Python version in the pythonRuntimeVersion function in  common.ts
 *    that is imported by other stacks.
 *
 * 7. Now you should be able to deploy the system with that version.
